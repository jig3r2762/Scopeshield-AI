💡 WHY SCOPESHIELD AI?

Scope creep costs freelancers and agencies thousands of dollars every year. Those "small requests" add up quickly:
• "Can you just add one more feature?"
• "This should be quick, right?"
• "I thought this was included..."

ScopeShield AI helps you identify these situations and respond professionally, protecting your time while maintaining great client relationships.

## Permission Justifications (For Chrome Web Store Review)

### storage
Used to securely store the user's API token locally in the browser for authentication with ScopeShield AI servers. This allows users to stay logged in without re-entering credentials.

### activeTab
Required to read email content from the current tab when the user explicitly clicks the "Analyze with ScopeShield" button. The extension only accesses email content that the user chooses to analyze - it never automatically reads or scans emails.

### sidePanel
Used to display analysis results in a convenient side panel, allowing users to view scope creep assessments and reply suggestions alongside their email without leaving the page.

### Host Permissions (mail.google.com, outlook.*)
Required to inject the "Analyze with ScopeShield" button into Gmail and Outlook email interfaces. The extension needs access to these specific email domains to add the analysis button and extract email content when requested by the user.
